# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Machine Learning)

This project builds a Credit Card Fraud Detection system using Machine Learning in Python. It classifies transactions as legitimate or fraudulent using historical transaction data.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Approach
- Load and explore the dataset
- Handle class imbalance using undersampling
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate the model using accuracy

## Model
- Logistic Regression (binary classification)


## Dataset Info
- 0 = Legitimate transaction
- 1 = Fraudulent transaction

## Note
The dataset is highly imbalanced, so undersampling is used to balance the classes.
